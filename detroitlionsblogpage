            <p class="summary">To open the regular season, the Lions visited the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs in the annual NFL Kickoff Game. The Lions took advantage of the Chiefs not having Travis Kelce, their star tight end, due to a knee injury sustained in their practice just two days prior to this game. The Lions started off hot, scoring in the first quarter via a nine-yard touchdown pass from Jared Goff to Amon-Ra St. Brown. The Chiefs scored 14 points in the second quarter via a one-yard touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes to Rashee Rice and a four-yard touchdown pass from Mahomes to Blake Bell, which made the score 14–7 in favor of Kansas City at half-time. The Lions responded with a 50-yard interception return by Brian Branch in the third quarter to tie the game. The Chiefs regained the lead via a 35-yard field goal by Harrison Butker. The Chiefs extended their lead in the fourth quarter via a 39-yard field goal by Butker. The Lions scored the final points of the game via an eight-yard touchdown run from David Montgomery, making the final score 21–20 in favor of Detroit. With the upset win, the Lions started the season 1–0 for the first time since 2017. They also won their first game at Arrowhead Stadium since 1988, which, coincidentally, was also won by a mere point.</p>
